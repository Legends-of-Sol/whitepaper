Yo, @legends! 

Remember how I said everyone would get a 3rd nomination if we we all piled in to @therealchaseeb xeet from 2021 and it got more than 50 comments? 

⁠💬-❅-weneral⁠

Well, we absolutely got him fam and you posted 57 comments like complete and utter Solana enjoyoooooors:

https://x.com/therealchaseeb/status/1748150740973982014

So the devs did something and... you can all now nominate a 3rd legend in our app for an airdrop of $LEGEND tokens for being Legendary and sticking the middle finger to SBF right through the bear market! 🎉

If you all want to celebrate, why not go and show your appreciation on Twitter by all randomly posting this silly banana image and tagging @0xbanana because he hasn't verified his nomination from @beeman yet and might get zapped! LFG ❤️

💻 Can the devs do something?💻 

There's a new role in the $LEGENDS discord specifically for the devs. 

In the next 48h we'll be trawling through Solana's devnet directory and assigning roles https://www.devnet.directory/

If you're a dev and not on the devnet directory list yet - NGMI. Although the rumour is you may be able to convince members of the @team by posting a link to your github and flexing those repos.

Devs are the heart and soul of buidling on Solana and we're keen to recognize you Legends.

:leolfg: Partner onboarding is soaring, Legends! :leolfg: 

This week has been a blast @everyone   🙏, with loads of projects joining Legends of SOL - shout out to @partners :raging_pepe: 

Also a big shoutout to @nicknmyap 💥 🔫  for his epic onboarding skills 💪

But demand is huge, so we're leveling up 🔥

We whipped up a new app in just 3 days to add some zest 🌶️

Familiar with the Legends' release style yet? Well this is no different fam, and we're going to honor @SOLBigBrain, a true ecosystem legend. Get ready! 👑

Here's the game plan:

1) Use your go-to AI image generator with this prompt [customize the text in brackets]:

"Create a pixelated character, showcasing a side profile of a cartoon monkey with distinct tan skin and vivid purple fur. The monkey should be wearing a stylish purple hat, decorated with a striking cyan and white stripe, complementing its purple shirt. A key feature is the gold chain around its neck, adorned with a pendant that is a miniaturized version of the monkey's own head. He is holding a large [item_here: e.g., banana, video game controller, magic wand]. The monkey is performing the action of [action/pose: e.g., jumping, sitting, playing an instrument]. Its expression is [expression: e.g., happy, thoughtful, mischievous]. It is also wearing [additional_feature: e.g., sunglasses, a scarf, a backpack]. The background should be a light tone simple solid color to emphasize the character's features. The artwork should be detailed, polished, and embody the sophistication of high-quality pixel art, reminiscent of advanced retro video games or high-end digital art in that style."

2) Tweet it out with:
"Here's to one of the greatest Legends of Solana, we love you @SOLBigBrain you're a #TotalLegendofSOL" ❤️
Your AI-generated image 🖼️
Tag #TotalLegendofSOL

After 20 posts, we'll reveal how to access the new app. Let's get this party started! 🎉🐵

🌌 Heads Up, @everyone! Big News just dropped! 🌌

Hey Legends! With the Solana scene all revved up for the $JUP token launch in just about 24 hours, we've been busy behind the scenes, and we've got some juicy updates for you.

🔧 Hard at Work Behind the Curtain 🔧
While the spotlight's been on $JUP, our tokenomics crew has been grinding away to dial in the ultimate airdrop experience for you all on Solana that ends in THE CHOICE. They're lining everything up just right for what's about to drop. You can expect the Litepaper in the next 24 hours.

🛠️ Introducing Our Latest Creation 🛠️
Right on cue with the $JUP excitement, we're stoked to unveil a degen tool we've put together. It's designed to be fun for you, and supercharge our partners, packing some serious value into any NFT project that hops on our airdrop train by giving them an inside look into sentiment analysis. This is a huge deal, because all tools currently available to NFT projects (Hellomoon, Tensor, etc.) are price action & rarity driven, so this is going to be a first for sentiment analysis. This will also be live in the next 24h.
But wait there's more - we’re also setting the stage for an open-source list of the crème de la crème Solana projects. This list is going to be a game-changer for airdrops aiming to target the true Solana aficionados. And yeah, if you're reading this, you're definitely one of them. Checkit out at  https://github.com/Legends-of-Sol/Solana-NFT-collections

🤝 More Partners Joining the Party 🤝

Our family is expanding, with more partners coming aboard. This means the airdrop is taking a tad longer to roll out, but trust us, it's worth the wait. We're making sure no one from our legend squad misses out.

🔄 New Onboarding Process for Partners 🔄

As part of this expansion, we're rolling out a new onboarding process for partners. Each new partner will be given the opportunity to add their collection to the Legends of SOL airdrop repository, AND our new tool for NFT sentiment analysis. The data from the tool is going to determine the airdrop allocation for our partners in a tiered grouping. This is what will be dropping as part of the Litepaper.
This isn't just about growing our ecosystem; it's about creating a richer, more connected network of projects and communities within Solana. By contributing to the airdrop repo, our partners are not only gaining visibility but also contributing to a collective resource that benefits the whole ecosystem. It's a win-win, strengthening our community ties and ensuring that the value we create together is shared across the board.

💡 Airdrop Philosophy: Celebrating the Enjoyooors 💡
This airdrop is more than just spreading tokens; it's about recognizing and rewarding those who stood by through thick and thin, especially after the storms like the FTX fiasco. We're here for those who see beyond the hype, who believe in Solana's tech and its potential to redefine blockchain for businesses.

Gear up, Legends! The next week is going to be epic. We're not just part of the Solana wave; we're here to make it bigger.

Stay tuned, and thanks for being the heart and soul of this Legends movement. LFG! 🚀

🌌 Heads Up, Legends! 🌌

We're finally able to release the airdrop tokenomics for @everyone ! Here's the breakdown on how we're going to drop the $LEGEND token allocation - finishing with an event that needs no introduction: 'The Choice.'

🙌 A huge thanks to the team at W3 Economic Labs for their creativity and hard work in making the tokenomics vision a reality. You can find them on X @W3EconomicLabs if you want to give them a follow.

How did we get here?

It's been a hectic couple of weeks riding a wave of interest in 'The Choice' and fine-tuning everything for the Legends of SOL airdrop. But we're making sure we nail every detail for an unforgettable experience in this crazy bonkers fast-paced Solana landscape.

So here's the skinny on the Airdrop:

Token Breakdown: We're giving you a clear picture of how the tokens will be distributed, setting the stage for the airdrop so you can prepare accordingly.
Legends of Sol Airdrop: 25% of our initial tokens, that’s over 1 billion tokens, are set to be distributed to 10,000 Legendary participants through the airdrop. These are going to be the core group making The Choice and it may well lead to your greatest Solana adventure yet.
Strategic Alliances: We’re partnering with some of the biggest projects in the Solana ecosystem to reward their communities and super-charge whatever comes next for each of them. This is about lifting all boats on a rising tide.

This is what the tokenomics looks like

With 10k Legendary bear market enjoyooooors in the mix, The Choice is going to draw a tonne of attention value into Legends of SOL, and we want to make sure that value is shared particularly with our partners, but also to other future Legends and legendary projects that cross our path. So with that in mind we've set all sights on the airdrop, with a secondary consideration about how we can continue to support Legends, and ignore grifters to pump the shit out of Solana.
Allocation Category

Solana Legends Airdrop: 25% (1,051,742,355 tokens) - This initial distribution is to reward the Solana Legends community.
Strategic Partners: 12.5% (525,871,178 tokens) - Distributions to Partners of Legends of SOL.
[Redacted]: 12.5% (525,871,177 tokens) - [Redacted].
Liquidity: Pools: 5% (210,348,471 tokens) - Initial liquidity pools including Openbook markets on Raydium, and pools on Orca and Meteora.
Liquidity: Other: 15% (631,045,413 tokens) - Liquidity withheld for use in platforms that offer borrow/lending, farms, derivatives, and optionally CEX listings.
Marketing: 5% (210,348,471 tokens) - Earmarked for tools, promotions, and sponsorship within CT and beyond.
Solana Ecosystem Reinvestment: 5% (210,348,471 tokens) - Reserved for cutting-edge Solana developers, including hackathon rewards and direct contributions to Legend development.
Team: 20% (841,393,600 tokens) - 10% upon token launch; 90% subject to 16M vest with linear unlock.
Total: 100% (4,206,968,002 tokens).

Inside the Airdrop:

Our Solana Legends Airdrop strategy will include a tiered system to make sure we recognise Solana's brightest and best in the appropriate fashion:

LEGEND Airdrop Tier

Top 1%: 100 wallets, 694,200 tokens per wallet, 6.6% of the Airdrop.
Top 5%: 500 wallets, 347,100 tokens per wallet, 16.5% of the Airdrop.
Top 10%: 1,000 wallets, 208,260 tokens per wallet, 19.8% of the Airdrop.
Legends: 8,400 wallets, 71,489 tokens per wallet, 600,512,355 total tokens allocated, 57.1% of the Airdrop.
Total: 10,000 wallets, 105,174 average tokens per wallet, 1,051,742,355 total tokens allocated, 100% of the Airdrop.

This tiered approach isn’t just about Legends getting Legendary amounts of recognition based on their Solana enjoyiiiiiing; it's aimed at building maximum chaos for 'The Choice' and giving you all an unforgettable experience. 
Give me 'The Choice' already:

I'm so excited about 'The Choice' and it's starting to feel like the team have done everything to set it up to go Boom! While we’re still keeping the finer details under wraps for now, be assured the reveal is going to be degen AF. So strap in, prepare for the airdrop, and stay tuned for 'The Choice.' LFG! 🚀✨

🚨 This is not a drill! 🚨

This important announcement is regarding the Legends of SOL nomination process and the upcoming $LEGEND airdrop @everyone! Mark your calendars and set your alarms because the cutoff date to become Legendary is fast approaching!

📅 Cutoff Date for Nominations: 6PM Monday, Feb 5 EST

If you haven't been nominated and verified on the https://legendsofsol.com/ app by this time, you'll miss out on the Nominated Legends allocation portion of the airdrop. Don't let the opportunity to be part of one of the greatest events in Solana history pass you by!

How It Works:
There's been some confusion about the airdrop allocations, so let's clear that up. The allocation of the Legend token will be tiered as per the previous announcement, based on several factors, including but not limited to:
Being nominated on the Legends of SOL website
Getting the MAXIMUM nominations verified for your Legends on the website
Owning partner NFTs in your connected wallet
Your connected wallet's history of transactions
Your general OG status in the Solana space

Partner Allocation:
Additionally, there's a separate airdrop allocation for our partners also described in the tokenomics announcement. The Legends token will be split among the Legends of SOL partners, ensuring everyone gets a piece of the pie. This is distinct and separate to the Nominated Legends airdrop.

Remember, this airdrop cannot be farmed. We're dedicated to making The Choice your best experience in Solana yet.

Stay tuned for the final dates of the $LEGEND airdrop and The Choice, and make sure to get your nominations in before the cutoff to avoid FOMO and disappointment! Let's make history together. 🌟

🚀 Are you fucking ready for The Choice @everyone ?! 🚀

It feels like forever, but in reality just 1 month ago Legends of SOL was born to capture all the Solana Bear Market enjoyooooors who endured the FUD post FTX. The most special group of mfers you'll ever meet in your life, bound together by an unshakeable understanding that Solana is the chosen one 🌟 that can take on the NASDAQ, process 500k TPS, and settle in micro-seconds to usher in a new age of fx. LFG! 🚀

So it is with great pleasure I can now announce the following:

🔒 Partner Role Closure:
Heads up, Legends! The gates 🚪 to the esteemed "Partner Role" have now swung shut. A massive shoutout to the 6̶9̶ 80 partners who've rallied an epic force of 4̶2̶,0̶6̶9̶ 56,753 Solana GOATS 🐐, ready to make "The Choice". Forged in Valhalla, braving the bear market 🐻 together like the legends you are, you have recognised the Legendary experience that awaits and graced us with your Legendary presence.
🔥 The Choice is Upon Us:
Brace yourselves! This coming Friday at 6:00 p.m. EST, it's time for "The Choice." You better be fucking ready, because this mfer is going to go down in history 📚. This isn't just any event; it's the decision that will define your journey forward. With only 4,200 spots available, "The Choice" is ALL about cementing your Legendary status 🌟.

As Morpheus clearly stated when referring to The Choice: "This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more."

Every move, every decision, every choice will unfold on LegendsOfSOL.com. It's where fate will be decided, Legends will be cemented, and lettuce handed virgins will be sacrificed on the altar of FOMO. All using the almighty $LEGEND as your weapon of choice.

⏰ Nomination Deadline Alert:
In the last 3 days, we've DOUBLED our number of partners, so we now need to give them and their communities time to onboard and get verified ✅.

NB: With such a tight allocation of 4,200 spots, you're going to need to make sure you have the BEST chance of making The Choice by having MAX Airdrop allocation of $LEGEND, and holding as many partner NFTs as you can in your connected wallet 🏦. It goes without saying that the more $LEGEND you have, the easier it will be to make The Choice.

NB!! The cutoff for nominating your chosen Legends is also this Friday at 6:00 p.m. EST. This is when we will take the final snapshot of Legends, the partners and their communities.
The Airdrop:
Feel your butt clench as "The Choice" goes live, a FULL 24 hours before The Airdrop descends on us 🪂. It's your chance to get in early and front-run your destiny. Once the gears start turning LegendsOfSOL.com will transform and the nomination tool will disappear to reveal The Choice and Airdrop claim page. There will be plenty of warning before this happens in the Discord and on Twitter 🐦.

🔥 $LEGEND Burn Notice:
But wait, there's more... in a cruel twist of fate, every $LEGEND token wielded by you, the Legends, in "The Choice" will be burned in the flames of Valhalla 🔥, forever etching your decisions into the annals of Solana. That's right, you heard correctly - we are going to burn that mfing $LEGEND token to the ground like absolute degens 🔥🔥🔥

Legends, this is more than an announcement; it's a call to arms ⚔️. Stand ready, for "The Choice" because it's not just an event; it's the moment where Legends are truly born. See you in The Matrix mfers!

TLDR;
Partner Role is closed
The Choice is this Friday at 6:00 p.m. EST
Nomination deadline is also this Friday at 6:00 p.m. EST
Airdrop is 24 hours after The Choice
$LEGEND will be burned in The Choice

LFG! 🚀🚀🚀

🚨 ALPHA ALERT 🚨

@everyone is asking for alpha, so here's a little something to get you started. We're dropping a fat stack of tokens on the Legends, and it's gonna be raining $LEGEND. 💰🌧

But look deeper and peep the tokenomics, and you'll transcend to Vince McMahon laser eyes level hype:

Allocation Category:

[Redacted]†: 12.5% (a whopping 525,871,177 tokens) - [Redacted].

In short? This stash is for the 💎🤲 OGs clutching onto The Choice like it's their last hope. We're talking about raining millions upon millions of tokens, outta nowhere. The more badass The Choice you end up choosing is†, the fatter the drop you're gonna catch. And yeah, Minter's *† getting a piece of the action too with some juicy prizes and whatnot.

We're all about hyping up Solana, backing its big moves, major airdrops, and all those fire partner launches. It's an endless party here, and our NFT fam is gonna be drowning in tokens while we boost Solana to the stratosphere.

And yo, keep this on the DL, but if you're smart, you'll rush towards The Choice like it's solid gold. Why? 'Cause we've got a sneaky 5% tucked away for the epic Saga 2 rollout†. Mum's the word, but this is the kinda intel that makes lettuce virgin hands (as the Chads would say), into diamond fists of fury. ✊💎

* Minter is alpha for an app that we've got in testing that's going to change the game for Solana NFT projects. It's a secret for now, but we're dropping hints like breadcrumbs. Keep your eyes peeled for more info. 🕵️‍♂️🍞
† ALPHA

TLDR; LFG! 🚀🚀🚀

:love::love::love: It's go time and I'm tearing up @everyone :love::love::love:

GM Legends! 🌅 I can't believe that in just over 30 days, from the initial idea to delivery, we're on the eve of The Choice. It's been the craziest ride, starting with a vision to capture a snapshot of the greatest bear market enjoyooors post-FTX collapse, those who bonded in the deepest, darkest market that Solana will ever know in its history.

Now that we're here, and we've gathered the Legends together, the numbers show that we have all the most OG of OG people from Solana together. I wanted to share some significant updates...

As some of you know, I have a rather demanding full-time job as a full-stack developer in New Zealand. The last three years, building on Solana, have been the busiest years of my life, juggling what essentially amounts to more than two full-time roles. It's certainly taken me through great highs and some really big lows. I built Solana's first social network with a vision to have a completely decentralized, open alternative to Twitter. It was really a fool's errand because, with just one guy, no team, and no funding, it was never really going to be possible, and I also made some mistakes along the way but I'm still proud of what I delivered. The funny thing was, just like we found through the bear market, through all those challenges, hard times, and problems, I met some of the most amazing people who I have ever had the pleasure to meet in my life and who I consider some of my best friends. It was those people who kept me going, and it's to them that I owe Legends because THEY are the Absolute Legends of SOL. It's true that, going to Breakpoint last year and meeting in real life was up there with the greatest moments of my life. This is all for you. 

Here's where we stand pre-snapshot:

Total Legends: 58,023
Total Partners: 83
Total Verified Legends: 5,223

Mind-blowing.

I quickly want to give a huge shout-out to all the members of the Legends team who have worked tirelessly over the last couple of weeks to keep everyone informed and keep the wheels greased and the oil flowing. It was really a team effort, even though most people haven't seen the craziness going on behind the curtain.

Overall, I'm so happy to have been able to capture and tokenize this group of Legends before the real bull market craziness kicks off in the next few months. If any of you have been around the space for any amount of time, you know we're about to head into the Bitcoin halving, which is the Grand-daddy blockchain tide on which all other blockchain boats rise. And as many of you remember, with the bull market comes all sorts of horrible grifters, people in it for the money, and generally just not great folks. So now that we have this Ark, I'm glad that we've secured a place where we can all continue the greatest vibes ever formed in that bear market as a collective.
I also want to share some ideas about what I plan to do with the Legends community and the $LEGEND token so you know what you're in for:

If Legends burns enough liquidity for me to leave my IRL job, I am going to run a huge experiment and tokenize myself as a dev into Harkl DAO for 6 months and use $LEGEND for people to bid on whatever dev tasks they want me to complete (did I mention I also do design and marketing and a whole bunch of other stuff).
With the almost 80 partners we've onboarded, as I've dug into the code on many of their collections, they are in all sorts of different states. I want to fix that. So, I'm going to focus on building tooling that levels all of these communities up and makes them the strongest they've ever been.
There's so much great data in this space, but it's all typically transactional and, ironically, most of the space runs on sentiment. I want to change the way we measure projects, and I have almost completed an app which I think is going to be one of the best sentiment measuring tools for tokens and communities that's ever been built.
There's too much focus on exit liquidity in the space, which is why we're going to be BURNING ALL of the $LEGEND tokens that are used to make The Choice, raising everyone's boats again.
And along the way, I've met some absolutely cracked devs in Solana, so I want to have the quality time and freedom to get alongside them and become better at my craft, and help to improve their products to onboard the next billion users into Solana.

My heartfelt thanks to you all. Whatever happens from here, it's not about the liquidity for me; we've done it. We've captured the greatest snapshot of the Solana Bear Market Community I could have ever hoped for, and I'm here for the long haul with you all. Let's make history together. 🚀

LFG

🚀🌌 LEGENDS OF SOL, THE DAY HAS ARRIVED! 🌌🚀

The Airdrop Claim is upon us @everyone. I'm absolutely stoked to have gotten here with you all and I'm even more stoked looking forward to what the future holds for Legends.

This game as you all know is full of smoke, mirrors, and grifters. But it's also full of some of the best people that exist in the crypto space. Looking at the data that we've gathered over the last 3 weeks I believe we have captured a snapshot of most of those people from the Solana space into a single Discord that will allow us to preserve the most immaculate vibes together through the incoming bull market (Did you see the NGU yesterday?). An Ark if you will for bear market enjoyoooors. So here's the deal.

Countdown Alert! ⏰ In just 4 hours, the LEGEND token airdrop goes live. Get ready for some of the wildest tokenomics you've ever seen. Here's the lowdown if you've been living under a rock:

Launch Date: 5 Jan 2024 📅
Token Holders: 777 (Lucky number, anyone?) 🍀

OK @everyone, we're aware of issue with multiple claims. Have drained the claim address and triaging currently. The saga continues.

We'll get there. If you got any over-allocation Legendary points will be bestowed for honesty. Of course this is a Wendy's so frfr no cap etc.etc.

We'll do an audit and look at the data as usual and then come back and get people sorted as always. The fun continues :harold:

@everyone 📣 Meeting Alert!

Hey Legends! 🌟 We're hosting our first town hall in 2 hours from now! The last 2 weeks have been a god damn hectic mess of a time and we've got hundreds of new Legends in the channel so we need to see who's here and get an idea of the Legends status. Also, we need to go over the craziness of what happened yesterday AND more importantly what happens next. We've got some AWESOME SHIT in store as per usual for the double claimers and some hilarious stories as well. 🚀

📅 Date & Time: Starting in 2 hours from now - Wednesday, 14 February 2024 12:00 in https://discord.com/events/1190413756325429268/1207076376528822353

Make sure to join us. We can't wait to meet all the new @legends in the channel! 🎉

See you there! 👋 

🚨 First Inaugural Town Hall and Degeneracy Anonymous Summary 🚨

Hey @everyone! Here's what you missed in our first town hall today 👋 TLDR; It's been an intense couple of days, and I wanted to give you all a quick breakdown of what's been happening behind the scenes, what's next for our airdrop, and some special instructions for our double claimers.

Last 48 Hours:
I was on a non-stop coding spree that resulted in some pretty janky code, working late into the night with an unwavering focus to push through the final stages of development and get the claim sorted. It was a race against time, and in my haste, with no tests to speak of and an already crappy codebase heaving with technical debt, I made a few mistakes.
We encountered several RPC issues that threw unexpected curveballs our way, and currently whenever the app loads up each user makes about 50 RPC requests. Add load to that and you basically just set whichever RPC you're connected to on fire and they start rate limiting you.
Amidst this RPC chaos, an unforeseen glitch allowed for a double claim on all airdrops. So a bunch of folks got a lot more than they should have. Ultimately, we pulled the tokens from the airdrop wallet so damages were minimal, and it was well worth it really because the degeneracy setting got turned up to 11.

What's Next - Airdrop V2.0:
The airdrop is STILL happening, I repeat THE AIRDROP IS STILL HAPPENING! We're going to get a few devs into the codebase, fix the worst of the bugs, and release again. It will likely be on Friday, but we'll give you all at least 24h warning when we have a fixed date.
Double Claimers - Here's Your Chance to Shine:
If you were one of the special people who managed a double claim, here's an opportunity to turn this into Legend Sauce. Here's what you need to do:

Reach out to @CdCruz , @Gus , or the @team to make you an @absolute legends   role
Join the channel ⁠💸-❅-double-spend
Distribute your unintended extra $LEGEND to your favorite NFT community in increments of 69,420 tokens so they can mint The Choice
Vibe with others who are in the same boat in the Channel, shit post, share ideas, and decide how you max vibe gifting the 69420 $LEGEND to NFT enjooooyors

This not only helps spread the love, but solidifies your status as an @absolute legends   within our community. We are always raising all yachts, frens.

Alpha
If you weren't there you missed it. Sorry! No refunds.

But it involves a highly reputable web 2.0 company and some IP negotiations.

Summing up
I understand the past few days have been a rollercoaster (feature not a bug), and totally appreciate the sorts of Legends this is drawing in who have been here before countless times and revel in the degeneracy. These hurdles and breakages are what made us all the most resilient group of Mfers Solana has ever seen. 🚀

LFG!

🎉 ANNOUNCING NEW ROLE: CERTIFIED LEGENDS FOR LEGENDS OF SOL 🎉

Prepare to ascend to a new echelon within the Legends of SOL community @everyone. We're rolling out an exclusive new role for the connoisseurs of The Choice NFT — Certified Legends. This isn't just a title; it's your actual key to the inner sanctum, where the elite convene and collaborate.

Elevate to Certified Legend:

Hold The Choice: To qualify for this prestigious role, you must be the proud owner of The Choice NFT. If you're not already a holder, you can still mint one from the Legends of SOL website.
Verification via PubKey: With the tech wizardry of @beeman , we're leveraging PubKey for a frictionless verification process.
Initiate at Dean's List Verification: Sync your Discord and connect your wallet. Ensure it's the wallet that's home to your NFTs. Got multiple wallets? No problem. You can link them all from the Settings.
Transformation: Post a brief 30-minute interlude, you'll be donning your new role and unlocking the gates to our exclusive channels.

Hats off to:
@beeman , for pioneering the PubKey tech that makes this all possible. Anticipate more innovation with the upcoming version of PubKey, promising deeper integration and perhaps even a custom-branded Discord bot for our legion.
Also Dean's List DAO, for their pivotal role in hosting the PubKey instance, powered by their commitment as a Platinum Tier Legends Partner.

This new role comes with its share of power and privilege, and we trust you'll wield it with integrity. The verified channels are our playground for the true Legends to innovate, connect, and grow the fucken pie.

Step up, take the helm, and solidify your legacy as a Certified Legend in ⁠🎪-❅-the-circus once you're connected.

🚀 To Greater Heights, Legends of SOL! 🚀

@everyone ✨ Attention Legends of SOL! ✨

After such a great disaster/success of our last launch of the $LEGEND token claim, we're back for more punishment! 🔥

Here's the new date, mfers:

📆 Date: Saturday, 17 February 2024 12:00 

After you pick yourself up off the floor from the shock of this project not being a rug, here's what else you need to know:

👉 What's going on?
The $LEGEND token claim window will last for 3 days!
If you spam "wen" in the chat and don't read this, there's a good chance you'll be kicked for not being Legendary enough
Reading is fucking awesome
You should read more often
We'll have a town hall once we mint out and I'll share some alpha (I've got the stage sorted this time and I won't do it from my mobile, promise)

@here If you want to celebrate, do it by heading over to Ian Cummings' post on X and write "Velvet Fist" in the comments  https://x.com/iancummingsnft/status/1758319249200705977 🌟 
ian c 🏇🌹 #solmvp (@iancummingsnft) on X
Would love to hear from fellow founders how you react (either publicly or privately) to 'we need more announcements' or 'we need more catalysts' crowd. I sure know how I react privately ha...

Do you prefer to rule with a velvet glove or iron fist?

Call me the bearer of tidings, both grim and somber, for I must impart upon thee a tale most unfortunate, akin to the harrowing voyages of Ahab in pursuit of the elusive leviathan. 'Tis with a heart heavy as the anchor plunged into the fathomless deep that I announce the second thwarting of our noble endeavor to claim the tokens of "Legends of SOL."

As mariners adrift amidst tempestuous seas, we've braved the squalls of technology, our sails billowed with hopes, yet again we find ourselves ensnared by the unforeseen, as the great whale that slipped Ahab's grasp. The mechanism of claim, our Pequod, hath faltered, leaving us to gaze upon the vast waters of possibility with naught but dismay.

Fear not, for our resolve shall not wane, nor shall our spirits be submerged beneath the waves of despair. As the crew aboard the Pequod, steadfast in the face of the boundless ocean's wrath, we too shall rally, undeterred by the tempests that seek to thwart our passage.

Let this announcement serve not as a dirge but as a clarion call to all stalwart souls who navigate the digital seas with us. We shall convene upon the morrow, under the great expanse of the digital ether, to chart our course anew. Our quest for the tokens, much like Ahab's for the white whale, remains indomitable, fueled by the unyielding spirit of adventure that binds us.

So, gather 'round, ye digital mariners, for though our voyage has met with travail, our saga continues, our fellowship unbroken. We shall embark once more upon the sea of codes, our eyes set upon the horizon, where the dawn of success shall break, as certain as the ship's return to the welcoming embrace of Nantucket's shores.

Bear this news with fortitude, for though the winds may howl and the waves may tower, the story of "Legends of SOL" is far from its closing chapter. Together, we shall navigate the uncharted waters, and in unity, find our bounty at journey's end. @everyone

@everyone 🚀 Legends of SOL have been cooking 🚀

Guess what Legends? Legends of Sol is the first group in the entire Solana ecosystem to integrate pubkey version 2! 🛠️✨

A huge shoutout to the legendary @beeman  🐝 for his based skillz in delivering the next version of pubkey. Most of you have seen him shit posting in the Discord and gathering market intelligence over the last couple of weeks. It's a pretty big deal to have a dev of his calabre so engaged with what we're cooking tbh. And it's also a testament to the strength of this Discord that he is comfortable testing in prod and rolling with the punches. We're forged in fire mfers.

As a result, for those who've lettuce handed their Choice NFT, you might've noticed a change - access to ⁠🎪-❅-the-circus  is no longer available. 🎪❌ But here's where it gets exciting...

Holding $LEGEND tokens in your connected PubKey wallet now unlocks a brand new role - @$legend holder . 🎖️ This is going to be your gateway to the realm of the cabal for people with $LEGEND. With this update, we're introducing a sophisticated level of access control, tailored to your NFT holdings and token possession. 🗝️💼

This advancement isn't confined to Discord alone; it extends to the suite of apps and tools we're currently rolling out. 📲🔧 The silence over the past few days? That's been the sound of our devs hard at work, innovating on multiple fronts. 🤫👩‍💻 TLDR; there's tonnes more stuff ready to drop in the coming days. Wen claim?

Remember, when Legends of Sol goes a bit quiet and the same 5 Legends are posting in the channel, it means we're cooking hard. And wen I say cooking I obv mean Haggis. And rest assured, with the level of talent in this team we're just getting started taking this Bear Market Ark to the promised land. 🌕💫

The journey's just begun. LFG! 🚀🌌

🚀 GM Legends! 🚀

Exciting news for @everyone! Thanks to the incredible efforts of @råbba  and @miester.all , we're thrilled to announce the reopening of the Legend claim. This isn't just software for Legends, it's open sourced and will benefit the WHOLE Solana community for all future airdrops. We give back mfers.

🌟 The new claim tool is now live at claim.legendsofsol.com. Of course if you hold The Choice NFT and are one of our @certified legends  in ⁠🎪-❅-the-circus  you had an inside track to this info over 12 hours ago. But if you're just finding out about it now, head to the claim URL and get your $LEGEND secured.

NB: ⏳ The claim window is open for the next 48 hours only. Don't miss out, as any unclaimed $LEGEND will return to the treasury forever to be unclaimed. And @partners - get the word out to your communities to claim that shit!

ALSO, hold onto your butts! Because this is an announcement about another announcement. (LFG) 🎉 Once the claim window closes, we're gearing up to reveal HOW The Choice NFT is going to work and what we've been cooking in the dark. This reveal isn't only going to be about Legends; it's a colab with some of our awesome partners and the specific super-powers that they bring that are #OPOS.

Fresh off a 2-hour brainstorming session for this delivery, our team is literally shitting their pants with excitement for what's ahead for the Legends of SOL. The future is SUPER-SAIYAN, and now we've done the drop we're just getting warmed up. 💪

Missed the pre-reveal mint and don't have a Choice NFT? Damn that sucks bro! But, a very limited selection is still up for grabs on the secondary market via tensor.

LFG, Legends! 💎

💡 The Choice Revealed

As promised we're lifting the skirt on The Choice to reveal a large part of what we're delivering.

Upgradeable NFTs & Trait Marketplace: It's time for NFTs to evolve. We're building upgradeable NFTs and a marketplace for traits that adds a whole new dimension collections. The Choice will be the first iteration of this MP.
Sentiment vs Transaction Data: At the moment tx data drives the NFT world - we want to change that by digging into sentiment analysis for NFTs.
Sustainable LEGEND Economy: The projects that extract value in this space is too damn high. With upgradeable NFTs and sentiment driven trait data our partner projects who engage will be able to embrace tools that add value to their collections and communities using the $LEGEND token.

We've got 19 seasoned veterans on the team now committed to this vision, and we're well setup with our partners and their representatives in the Legends community to launch a new way of doing NFTs on Solana; it's a leap into the future of digital collectibles with a foundation built on the $LEGEND token, that will underpin everything we do and be integral to the Legends of SOL economy. 

🌟 It's time to buidl a Legacy and upgrade the shit out of NFTs on Solana. LFG! 🌟

🚀💎 LEGEND ALERT: HOLD YOUR LEGENDS CHOICE NFT TIGHT! 💎🚀

LISTEN UP @everyone, especially HODLERS OF THE CHOICE! Before you do anything rash like listing your NFT, know this: Your Legends Choice NFT is your golden ticket. We're going to be randomly snapshotting The Choice holders over the next few weeks while we buidl, so you're going to need those NFTs in your wallet. 📸✨ 

Why, you ask? Because we're about to drop alpha that'll make you pumped. The snapshots are going to be happening randomly until we launch the Trait Chooser where you get to make more Choices with The Choice than you can imagine. We want to reward the @certified legends with the ability to get the MOST Legendary Traits in the collection and max pimp their NFTs. And don't forget that a HUGE 12.5% of the entire $LEGEND supply has been earmarked for distributing to future holders of The Choice NFT. It's gravy all the way down for hodlers, especially considering Legendary traits are going to be limited and will be able to be augmented for the cost of 1.42069 MILLION $LEGEND each. 🚀🔥

Worried about not having enough $LEGEND to reveal your Choice? Well don't anon, because there'll be a bunch of common traits that you can mint for free and they all look absolute fire.

Now the Claim Deadline has zoomed by, we've been toiling like madmen in the background getting The Chooser ready for the reveal. Even though we've been dropping breadcrumbs in ⁠🎪-❅-the-circus  we haven't dropped heavy alpha on what the collection looks like yet and I think it's going to cause a bit of a stir to say the least. And one thing's crystal clear: Moving your NFT? Big mistake. Hodling it? Biggest win. 🏆💼

Stay tuned, stay Legendary, and above all, stay HODLING those Legends Choice NFTs. The future's bright for those who do. 🌈✨

LFG! 🚀🚀🚀

@everyone 

IT'S SNAPSHOT TIME 📸 

Our secret snapshot tool for The Choice NFT holders is finalized, up and running, and will be taking snapshots at random times as of now. Don't list those bad boys or else you'll miss out on the fun of what's coming!

Legendary Traits For Legends Only 🔥

Remember our teaser about NFT upgrades? The excitement is just beginning. The pricing for the Legendary Tier Trait is now revamped to 420,690 $LEGEND! A drastic cut from the previous 1,420,690 $LEGEND allowing for multiple traits to dress up your NFT with.

How many traits can I throw on the NFT? How many tiers are there? What's a "loadout"? Is dev really ded? You'll just have to keep an eye out to get all the details!

Stay tuned, stay loyal, and above all, stay legendary. We're on the brink of something monumental and it's all unfolding with you at the heart of it🫶

🚀🌌 ATTENTION, LEGENDS OF SOL 🌌🚀 @everyone

Thought it was high time to do a bit of a recap of another crazy week in the Legends space.

Here's the TLDR:
📈 Our Coingecko listing is now live! Check it out here.
🛠 The Chooser is now 50% complete. SOON!
🤝 We're cooking behind the scenes with some super partners. SOON!
🚀 Our economics team is smashing it, and we're benefitting from their cabal.
🎥 Doubling down on video content production.
👏 Our mods are pwning, uncovering incredible opportunities.
💰 $LEGEND now has a short form token symbol - ℒ.
📣 The code cracking comp is... ongoing

The Chooser Alpha - What’s Coming:

The Chooser is set to supercharge the NFT space on Solana - it's a pioneering move at this scale as a protocol.As per usual, Legends of SOL is going to deliver everything with our trademark brand of Legendegeneracy. If you've been living under a rock here's some of the alpha we've dropped so far about what The Chooser is.

An NFT with hot swappable traits.
Transforming the Legend site so you can swap traits at will.
A single MYTHIC trait named The King Without Choices.
Traits purchasable with $LEGEND, priced by rarity (An economy baby).
An API for Solana projects to enable hot swapping traits on THEIR own NFTs.

And it's all going to be delivered just in time for the most epic part of the bull run.
Code Cracking Competition Recap:
We hosted a Legendary competition where I obfuscated ℒ1M $LEGEND in an account, hiding the key in an image on Github using steganography. The @Legends of SOL activated and it took them just over 24 hours to crack the code, with many devs collaborating to find the key. In true crazy Legends form, due to a Unicode conversion error, a single character in the key was altered by the algorithm. Oddly, the key still could be imported to the Solana cli and returned a valid address, but nothing could be transferred from the wallet! Does this qualify us for a Solana bounty? I have NFI, but what I do know is that we're going to double down. I've added another ℒ1M $LEGEND and a Choice NFT to the wallet and we're going to run it back. I promise it will be less dev oriented this time around too.

So Stay tuned for more updates and get ready for another round of code cracking!

#LFG Legends! 🚀🚀🚀

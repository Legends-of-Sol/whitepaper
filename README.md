## Introduction

Legends of SOL is a project that launched with the aim to airdrop a token called [$LEGEND](https://birdeye.so/token/LGNDeXXXaDDeRerwwHfUtPBNz5s6vrn1NMSt9hdaCwx?chain=solana), to projects and members of the Solana community who had been active throughout the bear market of 2022-23 to recognize and capture a snapshot of the community before the onset of the next bull market. This whitepaper outlines the project's history of the airdrop, tokenomics, the unique "The Choice" NFT, and our future plans for design and delivery of NFT tooling to add value to our partner projects through building a circular economy based on upgrading NFT traits.

## Airdrop History

The Legends of SOL airdrop was the core focus of the first weeks of Legends of SOL, marking a significant milestone in engaging and rewarding the community. Here are some key statistics and highlights from the airdrop:

- **Launch Date:** The airdrop officially commenced on January 16, 2024, with the announcement of the Legends of SOL website going live and the initiation of the $LEGEND token distribution.
- **Recognizing Legendary Status:** Leading up to the airdrop, the project team upgraded key community members to @absolute-legends status, recognizing their early and engaged support.
- **Social Engagement:** The airdrop tool was designed to foster social engagement, requiring participants to connect their Twitter, Discord, and Airdrop Wallet to claim their allocation. Additionally, community members were encouraged to nominate their peers, further expanding the reach and impact of the airdrop.
- **Token Distribution:** The $LEGEND token, with a max total supply of 4,206,969,420 tokens, was minted with specific allocations for airdrop participants, community rewards, and development funds. A total of 662M in $LEGEND tokens were successfully distributed to 3769 claimers as part of the airdrop claim.
- **Strategic Partnerships:** Legends of SOL established partnerships with 72 distinct OG projects within the Solana ecosystem, aiming to reward them for building through the bear market, post FTX collapse.
- **Claim Process:** The claim process for the airdrop was meticulously planned, with a cutoff date announced to ensure participants had ample time to claim their tokens. The team leveraged technical challenges to filter community members who were acclimatised to volatile market dynamics, and was able to gather together a select group of experienced and resilient community members as a result.
- **Community Growth:** The airdrop and subsequent activities significantly contributed to the growth of the Legends of SOL community, with an increase of 2273 Discord members and active engagement across social media platforms.

The airdrop not only served as a mechanism to distribute $LEGEND tokens but also as a catalyst for community building and engagement. It laid the foundation for a vibrant ecosystem centered around Legends of SOL, successfully setting the stage for building tools around NFT traits and sentiment.

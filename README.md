## Introduction

Legends of SOL is a project that launched with the aim to airdrop a token called [$LEGEND](https://birdeye.so/token/LGNDeXXXaDDeRerwwHfUtPBNz5s6vrn1NMSt9hdaCwx?chain=solana), to projects and members of the Solana community who had been active throughout the bear market of 2022-23 to recognize and capture a snapshot of the community before the onset of the next bull market. This whitepaper outlines the project's history of the airdrop, tokenomics, the unique "The Choice" NFT, and our future plans for design and delivery of NFT tooling to add value to our partner projects through building a circular economy based on upgrading NFT traits.

## Airdrop History

The Legends of SOL airdrop was the core focus of the first weeks of Legends of SOL, marking a significant milestone in engaging and rewarding the community. Here are some key statistics and highlights from the airdrop:

- **Launch Date:** The airdrop officially commenced on January 16, 2024, with the announcement of the Legends of SOL website going live and the initiation of the $LEGEND token distribution.
- **Recognizing Legendary Status:** Leading up to the airdrop, the project team upgraded key community members to @absolute-legends status, recognizing their early and engaged support.
- **Social Engagement:** The airdrop tool was designed to foster social engagement, requiring participants to connect their Twitter, Discord, and Airdrop Wallet to claim their allocation. Additionally, community members were encouraged to nominate their peers, further expanding the reach and impact of the airdrop.
- **Token Distribution:** The $LEGEND token, with a max total supply of 4,206,969,420 tokens, was minted with specific allocations for airdrop participants, community rewards, and development funds. A total of 662M in $LEGEND tokens were successfully distributed to 3769 claimers as part of the airdrop claim.
- **Strategic Partnerships:** Legends of SOL established partnerships with 72 distinct OG projects within the Solana ecosystem, aiming to reward them for building through the bear market, post FTX collapse.
- **Claim Process:** The claim process for the airdrop was meticulously planned, with a cutoff date announced to ensure participants had ample time to claim their tokens. The team leveraged technical challenges to filter community members who were acclimatized to volatile market dynamics, and was able to gather together a select group of experienced and resilient community members as a result.
- **Community Growth:** The airdrop and subsequent activities significantly contributed to the growth of the Legends of SOL community, with an increase of 2273 Discord members and active engagement across social media platforms.

The airdrop not only served as a mechanism to distribute $LEGEND tokens but also as a catalyst for community building and engagement. It laid the foundation for a vibrant ecosystem centered around Legends of SOL, successfully setting the stage for building tools around NFT traits and sentiment.

## Future Plans

As Legends of SOL continues to evolve, we have a clear vision for the future to add real utility to "The Choice" through hot-swappable traits, a trait market-place and NFT sentiment analysis tooling. By introducing dynamic, hot-swappable traits we aim to create a circular economy not only for Legends of SOL traits, but for the whole Solana NFT ecosystem. This is what we are in the process of executing in the coming weeks.

### The Choice NFT

"The Choice" NFT is the keystone to the Legends of SOL universe. It is the primary signifier for members Legends of SOL, unlocking full access to the Legends community through [PubKey](https://github.com/pubkeyapp) certification. "The Choice" NFT comes with several key features:

- **PubKey Certification:** Discord members validate their Choice NFT through [PubKey](https://github.com/pubkeyapp), unlocking full access to the insider Legends discord channels.
- **Hot Swappable Traits:** (In progress) Owners can change the traits of their NFT, allowing for customization and personalization.
- **Trait tiers:** 
  - **Common Traits:** Available for free, designed to add basic customization and personalization options for NFT owners on a budget.
  - **Uncommon Traits:** Offer slightly more unique customization options than common traits, providing a balance between accessibility and uniqueness.
  - **Rare Traits:** These traits are harder to come by and offer distinctive customization options.
  - **Epic Traits:** Even more unique and valuable, epic traits provide significant customization and rarity.
  - **Legendary Traits:** Priced at ‚Ñí420690 each, these traits offer highly unique and distinctive customization options, adding significant value and rarity.
  - **MYTHIC Trait:** A single, extremely rare trait named "The King Without Choices," available at a to-be-determined price.
- **Economic Utility:** Traits can be purchased with $LEGEND tokens, and will be able to be sold via a trait market place, and created for partners and events, introducing a circular economy for traits within the Solana NFT ecosystem.
- **Trait Market Place:** Delivered in a second round once the initial Legends NFT traits have been delivered and refined.

### The Chooser

The Chooser is a platform that will allow NFT owners to personalize and upgrade their NFTs with hot-swappable traits. All of the traits of Legends, are going to be made up of an assortment of the best traits across the Solana NFT ecosystem, a set of Legendary Solana NFT traits if you will. This also opens the door for our partner projects to have official partner traits that can further build attention, where we can make project specific experiences based on traits from specific collections to generate colabs and engagement. Combined with a market place API and the ability to engineer NFT collections imbued with different token and trait mechanics, the trait mechanics will be like nothing thats ever been built in the NFT space on any chain in the history of crypto.

### Sentiment Analysis of NFTs

Recognizing the emotional nature of the NFT market, Legends of SOL is pushing into sentiment analysis for NFTs. By developing tools and platforms that analyze sentiment data, we aim to provide our community and partners with actionable insights that go beyond the purely transactional data that has defined the analytics space to date. This sentiment-driven analysis will again link back into partner NFT projects to allow them to streamline their trait and character offering. It will also enable Legends of SOL to consult on NFT projects looking to deliver lore and artwork that is the most up to date with the current space zeitgeist.

### Sustainable Ecosystem Growth

The core of our future goals is to create a circular NFT economy based on traits and sentiment data for stakeholders. Through our existing and future partnerships, continuous platform delivery, and a team firmly based in the foundation of Solana NFT culture, Legends of SOL is poised to be a big part of the next wave of the NFT cycle. We are a project focused on long-term growth and the continuous delivery of value to our community, partners and the Solana ecosystem at large.

## Conclusion

With a seasoned team of experienced individuals, a high profile brand within Solana and a clear vision for the future, we are on a path to creating real value for our community and all Solana NFT projects we have partnered with. At this stage there are no OTC or VC opportunities open, and the sole way to engage is via the market. If you'd like to be part of this journey to super-charge the potential of every NFT project within the Solana ecosystem, you can purchase a [Choice NFT](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/the_choice) or [$LEGEND tokens]((https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-LEGEND)
), join our Discord and share in the vision.
